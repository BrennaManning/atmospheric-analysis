## Setup
### First things first: Fork/Clone this repository.

### Using Jupyter notebooks.
The analysis suite here is in the form of a jupyter notebook. *analysis_suite.ipynb.*  
This format allows the analysis to be done in a workbook where all code for processing data, and generating visuals and statistics is right there for you to see, and modify if you wish.  You are not required to modify any code in order to use this workbook. This workbook is a mix of text and code, with widgets to input what you want to analyse (datasets, features, etc.) providing instructions throughout of how to use.

For an explanation of how to install and get started with these notebooks, check out the Jupyter notebook [Quickstart Guide.](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

### Your data:
Save your data sets as .csv files in the 'data' folder of this repository. This will make them show up in the dropdown menu when you are selecting datasets to analyze/compare.

## Let's get started!
In your terminal: navigate to the folder containing *analysis_suite.ipynb*.

![alt text](https://github.com/BrennaManning/atmospheric-analysis/blob/master/images/terminal_find_folder.png?raw=true "")

Type "jupyter notebook" into the command line. 

![alt text](https://github.com/BrennaManning/atmospheric-analysis/blob/master/images/terminal_run_jupyter.png?raw=true "")

Your terrminal will show a message that looks something like this:


![alt text](https://github.com/BrennaManning/atmospheric-analysis/blob/master/images/jupyter_running.png?raw=true "")

And the jupyter notebook window should open in your web browser. That will look something like this: 


![alt text](https://github.com/BrennaManning/atmospheric-analysis/blob/master/images/jupyter_home.png?raw=true "")

All the files in your folder will appear here. Select analysis_suite.ipynb in this browser window to open the workbook. 

## analysis_suite.ipynb
Let's walk through all the steps of analysis using this notebook!

You will see many blocks of code in this notebook. If you are familiar with python, great. Feel free to edit the code as you wish. If you are not familiar with python do not worry. Everything you need to do can be done without touching the actual code. It is largely there for transparency's sake so you can see our exact analysis methods.
