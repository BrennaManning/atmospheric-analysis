### Using Jupyter notebooks.
The analysis suite here is in the form of a jupyter notebook. *analysis_suite.ipynb.*  
This format allows the analysis to be done in a workbook where all code for processing data, and generating visuals and statistics is right there for you to see, and modify if you wish.  You are not required to modify any code in order to use this workbook. This workbook is a mix of text and code, with widgets to input what you want to analyse (datasets, features, etc.) providing instructions throughout of how to use.

For an explanation of how to install and get started with these notebooks, check out the Jupyter notebook [Quickstart Guide.](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

### Your data:
Save your data sets as .csv files in the 'data' folder of this repository. This will make them show up in the dropdown menu when you are selecting datasets to analyze/compare.
